        <p class="intro">I was born and raised in Nepal. I spent my childhood surrounded by the scenic beauty of mountains and lush greenery. My hometown is a peaceful place that I love revisiting.</p>
        <p>I have a loving family and enjoy spending quality time with them. My hobbies include hiking, reading, and learning new technologies. <span class="sentence">I am passionate about exploring web development.</span></p>
        <p>Currently, I live in the United States, balancing my work, studies, and family life. I also enjoy celebrating festivals like Dashain and Tihar with my loved ones.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I love experimenting with new recipes and exploring new places. Traveling has been one of the best ways to refresh my mind.</p>
