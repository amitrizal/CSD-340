    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Welcome to building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2.</p>

    <p>
        My name is Amit Rizal, and I was born and raised in Nepal. I spent my childhood surrounded by the scenic beauty of mountains and lush greenery.  
        My hometown is a <span id="word1">________</span> place that I love visiting whenever I get the chance.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 2013, I moved to the United States, where I have been building my life and pursuing my dreams.  
        I have a loving family and enjoy spending quality time with them. My hobbies include hiking, reading, traveling, and learning new technologies.  
        <span class="hobbies">I am passionate about exploring <span id="word2">________</span> web development.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        Currently, I am studying software Development, which keeps me busy and fulfills my desire to learn more about changing technology every day.  
        I also enjoy celebrating <span id="word3">________</span> festivals like Tihar and Dashain with my loved ones, keeping my traditions alive.
    </p>

    <p>
        Traveling has been one of the most <span id="word4">________</span> ways to refresh my mind.  
        I love exploring new places, experiencing different cultures, and making unforgettable memories along the way.
    </p>
